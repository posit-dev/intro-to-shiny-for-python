## Introduction

This is the workshop website for the "Intro to Shiny for Python" Workshop at [Posit::Conf(2024)](https://posit.co/conference/).

While most of these materials are designed to be used in conjunction with the workshop, they also stand alone as an educational resource.

## Background

This workshop is aimed at people who are somewhat familiar with doing data analysis in Python, but do not have much of a background in Shiny. 

If you are brand new to Python we recommend spending a bit of time familiarizing yourself with the following topics before the workshop: 

- How to install Python packages in a virtual environment 
- How to do basic data manipulation with `pandas` or `polars`
- How to draw plots 
- How to clone a repository with git

## Pre-requisites


Please ensure you have followed the instructions in the [pre-requisites section](docs/pre-requisites.qmd)

## Acknowledgements

This material has been adjusted for a workshop at Shiny in Production, 2023. These adjustments are very minor, and the original work was done by Gordon Shotwell and Joe Cheng, for the workshop they taught at Posit::conf(2023).
